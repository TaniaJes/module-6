• Use mouse Hi-C and matched H3K27ac ChIP-seq data available on Big Purple:
	–Hi-C fastq files + ChIP-seq H3K27ac peaks
	–/gpfs/data/courses/bmscga2604/chromatin_organization
• Process the Hi-C paired-end sequencing data using HiC-bench or HiCExplorer
	–Align against the respective reference genome and generate filtered valid pairs
	–Generate .hic files for visualization
	–Create and normalize Hi-C contact matrices
• Perform downstream analyses
	–Call A/B compartments (use H3K27ac ChIP-seq data to discriminate A vs B)
	–Compare A vs B compartments per chromosome in terms of gene density, housekeeping gene density and H3K27ac peak density
• Visualize a 10Mb locus and include a track that shows the compartment score
